# TypeScript Course for Beginners

The source code of this repository is taken from Academind's [TypeScript Course for Beginners 2020 - Learn TypeScript from Scratch!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwuLxPH8IDs&t=103s) video.

It is a pretty good course but I think instructor takes too much time to explain simple things. But overall, its a good course.
